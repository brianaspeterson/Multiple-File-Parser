The goal of this code exercise is to parse all of the input files then sort and print the combined contents, using 3 different sort orders. 

Each input file has a different format but should be printed the same way. The formats are as follows:

  -- Input Formats --
comma.txt - comma separated fields
Last Name, First Name, Gender(Male or Female), Favorite Color, Birthday(M/D/YYYY)

space.txt - space separated fields
Last Name, First Name, Middle Initial, Gender(M or F), Birthday(M-D-YYYY), Favorite Color

pipe.txt - pipe separated fields
Last Name, First Name, Middle Initial, Gender(M or F), Favorite Color, Birthday(M-D-YYYY)

The output should be printed in the following format: 

  -- Output Print Format --
Last Name, First Name, Middle Initial, Gender(M or F), Birthday(MM/DD/YYYY)

.. and sorted in the following orders:

  -- Output Sort Orders --
By Last Name, A to Z, then First Name, A to Z
By Gender, women before men, then By First Name, A to Z, then by Last Name, A to Z
By Age, oldest first, then by First Name, Z to A, then Last Name, Z to A

Included with this exercise is an example output in which the sorting is correct. It is not required that your output look *exactly* like the sample. The order and the format of the data is more important.

Good luck and let us know if you have any questions.



-could sort into separate arrays and then print
- could sort into a hash map with the same key if its the same type
- do multiple cases in if ( delimiter and key value)
